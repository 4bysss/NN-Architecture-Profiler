# PyTorch Neural Network Architectures Evaluation Project

## Description

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various neural network architectures using the PyTorch library. The primary focus is to analyze the performance and effectiveness of different architectures on specific datasets.

## Objectives

- Explore and understand common neural network architectures.
- Implement and train these architectures using PyTorch.
- Evaluate architecture performance on reference datasets.
- Compare and analyze results to identify strengths and weaknesses of each architecture.

## Methodology

1. **Architecture Selection:** We will select a diverse set of neural network architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, MLPs, etc., to address different types of problems like image classification, natural language processing, etc.

2. **Implementation:** Each architecture will have its own folder named after the architecture type. These folders will contain implementation scripts, model definitions, loss functions, and optimizers.

3. **Training and Evaluation:** Models will be trained and evaluated on reference datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDB, adjusting hyperparameters and configurations as needed.

4. **Comparison:** We will compare the results of each architecture in terms of performance, convergence speed, and generalization ability.

5. **Analysis:** Results will be analyzed to determine when and why certain architectures outperform others in different task types.
